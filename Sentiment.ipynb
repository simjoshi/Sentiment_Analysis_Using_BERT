A lovely big restaurant with a bar at the front (which is a bit awkward to try and push past everyone to get to your table). Friendly, helpful staff which is always a good start. The menu is large so we went with the \"feed me\" selection. All you need to do is sit back and let the chef feed you. As the other reviewers have stated the corn is a highlight and the pulled pork tacos, the sangria wasn\\'t bad either.Loved the Mexican tapas style food and will be back.'"
